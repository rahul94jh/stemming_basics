Spirituality is a broad concept with room for many perspectives. In general, \
it includes a sense of connection to something bigger than ourselves, and it typically \
involves a search for meaning in life. As such, it is a universal human experienceâ€”something \
that touches us all. People may describe a spiritual experience as sacred or transcendent \
or simply a deep sense of aliveness and interconnectedness.Some may find that their \
spiritual life is intricately linked to their association with a church, temple,\
mosque, or synagogue. Others may pray or find comfort in a personal relationship \
with God or a higher power. Still others seek meaning through their connections \
to nature or art. Like your sense of purpose, your personal definition of \
spirituality may change throughout your life, adapting to your own experiences \
and relationships."
